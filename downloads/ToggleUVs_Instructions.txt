Instructions:
simply extract all of the contents from the .zip to C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CC 2015\Presets\Scripts. Then when you start Photoshop you will have a ToggleUVs_Simple entry under File > Scripts. 

You need to have a Group named "UVs" for this to work.  When ran, this script will toggle the visibility of that group.
